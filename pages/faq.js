                    For your first visit, we will send one of our professional
                    maids to your home. We strongly recommend that you are
                    present during this visit, as it will give you the
                    opportunity to provide your own detailed instructions and
                    expectations. If you are satisfied with the service, we will
                    assign this maid to your home for all future visits.

                    We only hire experienced personnel who have years of
                    experience in the industry. In addition to their experience
                    level, they must all pass a criminal record check, a
                    rigorous interview process, and a training program that
                    involves passing a final examination.

                    While we do offer pre-structured plans that cover the usual
                    items, our prices are on an hourly rate basis. This means
                    that you can ask our staff to spend the time exactly how you
                    want, on anything you want, within reason. Our staff retains
                    the right to refuse work they deem unsafe. You must also
                    provide all the necessary tools and equipment required to
                    perform these tasks.

                  </summary>
                  <p>
                    Yes. There are a couple of major reasons for this. Firstly,
                    this allows your home to be cleaned with the products of
                    your choice that are best suited for your home. Secondly,
                    part of what allows us to offer the best rates in the area
                    is the fact that our staff operates independently and does
                    not always have access to crew vehicles where supplies and
                    equipment can be carried. Many of them use public transit to
                    get around. Some of our staff may bring their own products,
                    but they will only use them with your authorization. For a
                    list of the required items to have on hand, click here.
