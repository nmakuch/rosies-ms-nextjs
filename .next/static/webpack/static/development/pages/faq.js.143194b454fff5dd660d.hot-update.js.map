In addition to their experience\n                    level, they must all pass a criminal record check, a\n                    rigorous interview process, and a training program that\n                    involves passing a final examination.\n                  </p>\n                </details>\n                <details open>\n                  <summary>\n                    <span>\n                      3) What will Rosieâ€™s Maid Service clean within my home?\n                    </span>\n                  </summary>\n                  <p>\n                    While we do offer pre-structured plans that cover the usual\n                    items, our prices are on an hourly rate basis. This means\n                    that you can ask our staff to spend the time exactly how you\n                    want, on anything you want, within reason. Our staff retains\n                    the right to refuse work they deem unsafe. You must also\n                    provide all the necessary tools and equipment required to\n                    perform these tasks.\n                  </p>\n                </details>\n                <details>\n                  <summary>\n                    <span>4) Do I need to provide the cleaning supplies?</span>\n                  </summary>\n                  <p>\n                    Yes. There are a couple of major reasons for this. Firstly,\n                    this allows your home to be cleaned with the products of\n                    your choice that are best suited for your home. Secondly,\n                    part of what allows us to offer the best rates in the area\n                    is the fact that our staff operates independently and does\n                    not always have access to crew vehicles where supplies and\n                    equipment can be carried. Many of them use public transit to\n                    get around. Some of our staff may bring their own products,\n                    but they will only use them with your authorization.
